## Understanding Research Methods

### What is research and what does it mean being a researcher

Research is not just about gathering information, it's about adding maybe small, specific contributions to existing body of knowledge. Research is about you posing a question which has to have relevance to the world we are living

=> **Research is a systematic inquiry that helps to make sense of the world and that helps to make sensible the debates and interpretations that we have of issues of contemporary significance.**

> **What makes a good research question**

- A research question has to address something of ==significance==, some issues, some problems, questions that relate to the interests of broad community
- It has to be well ==researchable==
- It has to address the question that hasn't been definitely answered

> **NOTE: Knowledge is cumulative**

### The literature review – its role within research

#### What is literature review?

> A literature review is a ==structured investigation== on what has already been written on a given topic. It enables the researcher to become familiar with existing debates, identify consensus or disagreement in the field, and evaluate the strength of evidence surrounding key issues. More than a collection of summaries, the literature review involves making critical judgments, drawing connections between sources, and identifying where new research might contribute meaningfully.

#### Why literature reviews matter

It helps researchers clarify their own question by revealing what has already been asked and answered. It also reveals gaps or weaknesses in the literature—areas where more research is needed. Critically, it offers insight into theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches that have been used in similar studies, enabling researchers to adopt or adapt strategies that have already proven useful.

#### Literature reviewing as a form of research

It involves many of the same elements as primary research: defining a question, selecting data (in this case, texts), applying criteria for inclusion and exclusion, analysing material, and synthesising findings.

#### Types of literature reviews

| Review type    | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| **Narrative review** | Offers a broad, often thematic summary. Flexible but may lack rigour or clarity. |
| **Systematic  review** | Rigorously structured to answer a specific question. Transparent and replicable. |
| **Scoping review** | Explores the breadth of literature on a topic, often in emerging or complex fields. |
| **Meta-analysis** | Statistically combines results from multiple quantitative studies. |
| **Realist review** | Investigates how and why interventions work in specific contexts. |

#### Skills developed through literature reviewing
- Formulate focused and meaningful research questions
- Search literacy
- Critical appraisal
- Synthesise findings
- Academic writing and argumentation

#### Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Describe studies in isolation
- The use of unclear or inconsistent inclusion criteria
- Relying too heavily on secondary sources, overlooking recent developments, or failing to explore methodological diversity are also noted concerns.
> To avoid these traps, the authors recommend applying a systematic mindset


### The selection of a research approach

#### Research approaches
- **Qualitative**: Focuses on understanding meaning through rich, descriptive data. Typically used when the goal is to explore experiences, perspectives, or complex processes.

- **Quantitative**: Uses measurable data to test hypotheses or examine relationships between variables. Often applied to studies aiming for objectivity, prediction, or generalization.

- **Mixed Methods**: Combines both qualitative and quantitative data to gain a more complete understanding of a research problem.

#### Three core components of a research approach
- The **Philosophical worldviews (thế giới quan triết học)** reflects the researcher's beliefs about what counts as knowledge and how it can be known. This includes assumptions about reality, the role of the researcher, and the nature of truth or meaning. Whether a researcher views knowledge as objective and measurable or as socially constructed and interpreted will shape how they approach their study.
- Next is the **research design**, which serves as the overall strategy or blueprint for the project. It determines the logical structure of the inquiry, such as whether the study will follow a case study, experimental, ethnographic, or survey format. The design connects the researcher’s worldview to the specific procedures they will use to investigate their question.
- Finally, the **research methods** refer to the concrete techniques used for collecting and analyzing data. This includes decisions about what kind of data will be gathered (e.g., numerical data from surveys or textual data from interviews), how it will be collected, how it will be interpreted, and how the researcher will ensure its quality and validity.

##### Philosophical worldviews
| Worldview | Worldview |
| ---- | ----|
|**Postpositivism**| Deterministic, objective, and aimed at testing theories; common in quantitative research.|
|**Constructivism**| Focuses on understanding meanings and experiences from participants’ perspectives.|
|**Transformative**| Advocates for change and justice, especially among marginalized communities.|
|**Pragmatism**| Focused on practical solutions; blends methods as needed to address research problems.|

##### Research design

| Research Approach | Common Designs               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Qualitative**   | Narrative research           | Explores the stories and experiences of individuals.                        |
|                   | Phenomenology                | Focuses on the essence of lived experiences shared by several individuals.  |
|                   | Grounded theory              | Builds theories grounded in data collected from participants.               |
|                   | Ethnography                  | Involves immersion in a cultural group to observe and describe shared behaviors and beliefs. |
|                   | Case study                   | Provides an in-depth analysis of a single case, setting, or event.          |
| **Quantitative**  | Survey research              | Collects structured, numerical data to describe trends, attitudes, or characteristics in a population. |
|                   | Experimental research        | Tests cause-and-effect relationships through interventions and measurement. |
| **Mixed Methods** | Convergent design            | Collects qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously and integrates them. |
|                   | Explanatory sequential design| Starts with quantitative data, followed by qualitative analysis to explain the results. |
|                   | Exploratory sequential design| Begins with qualitative exploration, followed by quantitative methods to test or extend the findings. |

##### Research methods
Methods refer to the specific tools for gathering and analyzing data. These include:

- Interviews, observations, documents (qualitative).
- Surveys, tests, measurements (quantitative).
- A combination of both in mixed methods.

##### Making an informed choice
Creswell outlines several practical criteria to consider when selecting a research approach:

- The research problem: Is it exploratory, predictive, or in need of multiple perspectives?
- Researcher experience: Are you trained in stats, narrative inquiry, or both?
- Audience expectations: What do your supervisors, journals, or institutions value?
- Resources: Do you have the time and tools needed to conduct mixed methods, for example?


### How do you know you have been a good researcher
- Think about how your own sense of professional satisfaction 
- Think about it's convincing audience
- Think about social impact of your research
