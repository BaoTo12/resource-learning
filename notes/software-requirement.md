**Use Case Diagram's Components**
- **Use Case** is a function that users can do to achieve something in the system
- **Association** is a interaction with use case, like who uses what functions or use cases
- **Actor**: roles --> can be draw with rectangle
- **System** defines the system boundary
- **Include** relates to the included use case to indicate inserted behavior
- **Extend** is a relationship between two use cases in which one is a variation of another

Use case diagram symbols and notation

- **Use cases**: Horizontally shaped ovals that represent the different uses that a user might have.
- **Actors**: Stick figures that represent the people actually employing the use cases.
- **Associations**: A line between actors and use cases.
- **System boundary boxes**: A box that sets a system scope to use cases. All use cases outside the box would be considered outside the scope of that system.
- **Include Relationship**: The Include Relationship indicates that a use case includes the functionality of another use case.
  ![Include Relationship](./images/include-relationship.png)
- **Extend Relationship**: illustrates that a use case can be extended by another use case under specific conditions.
  ![Extend Relationship](./images/extend-relationship.png)
- **Generalization Relationship**: The Generalization Relationship establishes an "is-a" connection between two use cases, indicating that one use case is a specialized version of another.
