## How to find and evaluate academic sources

### Types of Sources
**Primary sources** → First-hand evidence. (Bằng chứng trực tiếp)
- Example: Interview with a woman injured in an accident.

**Secondary sources** → Report/analysis about primary events.
- Example: Newspaper article about that accident.

**Scholarly sources** → Written by experts, published in academic journals. Reliable for research.

**Popular sources** → Magazines, blogs, news for entertainment or casual reading. Not for academic writing.

### Reliable vs. Unreliable Sources
#### Reliable
- Written by experts (UN, scholars, institutions).
- Clear purpose: to inform, educate, or share research.
- Supported with references, peer-reviewed.
Example: library databases such as Google Scholar, and Sage Open, JSTOR, LexisNexis, ProQuest, CQ Researcher.
#### Unreliable
- Blogs, Wikipedia, eHow, entertainment sites.
- Written quickly, often biased, not reviewed.
⚠️ Google không phải nguồn học thuật. Hãy dùng Google Scholar hoặc cơ sở dữ liệu thư viện.


### How to evaluate sources
- Who wrote it? (Author’s expertise) 
- Who published it? (Organization, university, government?)
- What’s their purpose? (Inform or sell something?) 
- Are they biased? 
- Is it up to date?
- Is it accurate (no mistakes)? 

Examples
- FindLaw → Not reliable. It’s a marketing site for law firms, not academic.
- UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) → Reliable, well-researched, accountable.
- Google Scholar → Reliable academic articles.
- Google.com → Too many, mostly unreliable.

### Taking notes during evaluating sources
- Academic articles are long → hard to remember everything.
- Take notes for each article you read:
    - Citation info (title, author, journal, date, source, access date).
    - Short notes/phrases about key ideas (not full sentences).
- Notes keep you organized and save time when writing your research paper.

### Annotated Bibliography (thư mục chú giải)
This is a written summary and/or evaluation of your sources for the research paper. This summary or evaluation should be written as a paragraph or two for each source. An annotated bibliography is not part of the research paper, but it is a step in the research process. 

Common features to include in annotated bibliography:
- the source information in correct format (MLA, APA, or other)
- summary of each source's main points
- evaluation of each source's reliability
- evaluation of each source's usefulness to your research
- evaluation of each source's effectiveness

> Format MLA: **Author(s). "Title of Article." Title of Journal, vol. #, no. #, Year, pages. Publisher/Database, DOI/URL.**

### Thesis Statement

> **Thesis Structure**: A topic + A controlling idea(your opinion or argument about that topic)

> **Debatable**: A thesis must be arguable. If everyone already agrees, it’s not worth writing a research paper on.
Example: “Exercise is good for health” ❌ (too obvious).
→ “The government should provide tax incentives for companies that give employees free gym memberships” ✅ (debatable).

> **Complexity**: A research paper thesis needs to be more developed than a simple statement.
Avoid short, basic claims → add depth with conditions, reasoning, or predictions.
**==Structure for a Complex Thesis Statement==**
>- **Formula 1: Cause + Effect + Policy**
--> Because [cause/problem], [stakeholder] should [policy/action] in order to [effect/outcome].
>- ✅ Example:
Because fossil fuels are finite and environmentally destructive, governments should increase funding for alternative energy in order to ensure long-term sustainability.
>- **Formula 2: Although X, Y + Justification**
--> Although [opposing view or limitation], [your claim], since [reason/justification].
>- ✅ Example:
Although fossil fuels remain cheaper and widely available, governments should prioritize funding for alternative energy, since long-term dependence on nonrenewable sources will intensify environmental and economic crises.
>- **Formula 3: Condition + Recommendation + Consequence**
--> If [condition/problem], then [stakeholder] must [policy/action], otherwise [negative consequence].
>- ✅ Example:
If governments fail to invest more in alternative energy, then societies will face both severe environmental degradation and future energy insecurity.



Examples
- “If the Northern States had not won the American Civil War, slavery would have continued in the US for another 50 years.”
    → Topic = Civil War outcome.
    → Controlling idea = slavery would continue 50 years.
    → Debatable = historians could argue longer/shorter.
- “Pregnant women who are addicted to drugs must be admitted to hospitals to receive treatment so that their babies are not born dependent.”
    → Topic = pregnant women & drug addiction.
    → Controlling idea = must be hospitalized for treatment.
    → Debatable = who pays? will it work?


### Language For Research Writing

#### Types of informal language
> **Use Third Person Pronouns**: In academic writing, avoid “I, me, my” (first person) and “you, your” (second person). Instead, use third person pronouns like “he, she, they, their.”

> **Avoid Slang**: Do not use casual words like screw up (make a mistake), bummed (disappointed), 24/7 (all the time). Replace them with formal equivalents.

> **Do Not Use Contractions / Không dùng dạng rút gọn**: Write “cannot” instead of “can’t,” “will not” instead of “won’t.” Contractions make writing informal.

> **Avoid Overly Emotional Language**: Don’t call people “idiots” or “murderers” in academic work. Instead, use neutral terms like “those who disagree” or “violent criminals.” Emotional words weaken logical tone.

> **Avoid Clichés / Tránh sáo ngữ**: Phrases like “in today’s society,” “this day and age,” “time will tell” are clichés. Replace with clear, precise words (e.g., “today,” “currently”).

> **No Exclamation Marks (!)**

> **No Questions as Thesis or Topic Sentences**: Do not write thesis statements or topic sentences as questions. A thesis must be a statement with a topic + controlling idea.

#### Statistics In Writing
Statistics are numbers, percentages, or ratios that describe groups. They provide factual support for ideas in research papers. Subjects like science, health, sociology, or criminal justice rely heavily on statistics. In other fields like English, they may be less central, but statistics can still strengthen arguments.
> Correct ways to use statistics
- As a hook in the introduction. (Dùng như mở bài gây chú ý.)
- As supporting details in body paragraphs.
- In a statistics paragraph (sometimes with multiple statistics).
- Occasionally in bullet points (depending on teacher’s rules).
> Places you should NOT use statistics
- Not as a thesis statement (thesis must be debatable, statistics are facts).
- Not as topic sentences (topic sentences should express your own idea).
- Not at the end of body paragraphs (statistics need analysis afterward).
- Not in the conclusion paragraph (no new information should appear).

> **How to structure a paragraph with statistics**
- Start with your own idea in the topic sentence.
- Introduce the source of the statistic.
- Present the statistic clearly (blend numbers into the sentence).
- Use a logical order if multiple statistics (e.g., largest → smallest).
- Analyze the statistic (explain its meaning for your argument).
- End with a concluding thought (inference, recommendation, or prediction).
